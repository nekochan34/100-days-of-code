# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Tuesday.Janurary.2

**Today's Progress**: Started a project today. Started a multiplication table but not sure how I want to highlight the pieces. Could have hover, or draggable div on top of the table. Not sure yet...also want to have some text in there that clearly shows the equation you want. More work on this one tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** Should have started yesterday, but 100 days from now it won't matter. April.12 is 100 days from now - seems so far away.
